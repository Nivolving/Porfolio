                            <h4>About.</h4>

                            <p>Born and raised in India, pursued Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering, Anna University.
                            Worked in Infosys as Senior systems Engineer for 4 years. I have worked in couple of projects.
                            First project with Astrazeneca, UK based pharma, worked as Citrix tool Admin. Second project was with Bank of America
                            as Risk and compliance analyst. 
                            Moved to the states in 2016 after marriage.</p>

                            <h4>Life in States.</h4>

                           <p> My first city was Atlanta,GA. Definietly a stranger land but started exploring the place i lived in. Adopted a sweet four legged boy and named him Jon.
                            Made a handful of good friends. Rescused couple of dogs and found them forever home. Passionate about dog sitting. I have worked in Publix and Albertsons as bakery clerk and deli clerk.
                            From the Deli to the bakery from Cooking chicken to baking cookies i have been everywhere.</p>

                            <h4>Profession & Passion.</h4>

                            <p>At present I am working as a Azure cloud computing engineer with Mindtree LTD, Bellevue. Great team and Engaging job. But my career was Definietly missing the flavor.
                            I belive strongly that anyone with good resource and great passion can go miles, coming from computer science background never had a chance to work in 
                            developement side of computers also never had good hands on experience with developement, thats the reason i joined this bootcamp with University of Washington.</p>
